## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Backend (Flask)
- **Framework**: Flask with Flask-SocketIO
- **Database**: SQLite for game persistence
- **Real-time**: WebSocket communication for multiplayer
- **Game Logic**: Python classes for game state management

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- **UI Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript with modern CSS
- **Styling**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive design
- **Animations**: CSS transitions and transforms
- **Real-time Updates**: Socket.IO client for live game updates

### Key Components
- `color_game_app.py`: Main Flask application
- `templates/index.html`: Landing page with game mode selection
- `templates/game.html`: Main game interface
- `GameState` class: Game logic and state management
- WebSocket handlers: Real-time multiplayer support

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
You can customize the game by modifying these constants in `color_game_app.py`:

```python
# Game configuration
BOARD_SIZE = 8  # Change board size (affects game length)
COLORS = ['#FF0000', '#00FF00', ...]  # Customize color palette
GAME_MODES = ['human_vs_computer', ...]  # Available game modes
```

### Database
The game automatically creates a SQLite database (`color_game.db`) to store:
- Game history
- Player statistics
- Game results

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Colors
Edit the `COLORS` list in `color_game_app.py`:
```python
COLORS = ['#FF0000', '#00FF00', '#0000FF', '#FFFF00', '#FF00FF', '#00FFFF', '#FFA500', '#800080', '#NEW_COLOR']
```

### Changing Board Size
Modify `BOARD_SIZE` in `color_game_app.py`:
```python
BOARD_SIZE = 10  # Creates a 10x10 board
```

### Styling
Customize the appearance by editing CSS in the HTML templates:
- Color schemes in `templates/index.html` and `templates/game.html`
- Layout adjustments for different screen sizes
- Animation timing and effects

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port Already in Use**
```bash
# Change port in color_game_app.py
socketio.run(app, debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)
```

**Dependencies Not Found**
```bash
# Reinstall requirements
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

**WebSocket Connection Issues**
- Ensure firewall allows connections on port 5000
- Check browser console for connection errors
- Verify Socket.IO client version compatibility

### Debug Mode
The application runs in debug mode by default. For production:
```python
socketio.run(app, debug=False, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

## üìä Game Statistics

The application tracks various statistics:
- Total games played
- Active games
- Player 1 wins
- Player 2 wins
- Game completion rates

Access statistics via the API endpoint:
```
GET /api/games
```
